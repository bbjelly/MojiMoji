For ORGANISING THE DATASET, make the directory sorted_set/ with all 8 of the classifications as subdirectories.
Then use the script I modified for unix machines called sortedset.py

All scripts in the emotion recognition tutorial use windows file notation, so you
have to replace all \\ with / in the provided scripts.
